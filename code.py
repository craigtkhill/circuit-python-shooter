# create an instance of the controllerlightpatterns class

    # The appropriate classes/modules are imported. 
    # Instances of both classes are created. 

# if the boards switch is set to true  then the methods from the LightPatterns class
# should be called with reference to the instance you created to generate a light pattern.

    # The switch is implemented. 

# If the board’s switch is set to False, then the methods from the
# ControllerLightPatterns class should be called with reference to the instance you
# created to generate a series of patterns controlled by the board’s sensors.

    # All of the methods in the instances of the 
    # LightPatterns  and ControllerLightPatterns  
    # classes are called in the continuous program 
    # loop.

# calling the methods is for testing purposes only.

# Comments clearly demonstrate what the main 
# code is achieving and what each method call is 
# doing in the code.
